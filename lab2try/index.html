										<p><strong>Hi there! I’m Rjam Abuacan</strong>  19 years old and you can call me anytime. Just kidding, you can call me Rjam or jam for short, anything will do. Trivia, did you know that my name came from the first letter of my parent’s name and yeah as you say “Share mo lang? and yes Share ko lang” I live in Bangkal, Makati City yes, it is near the school but unfortunately SOMETIMES I can’t go to school on time because I’m too lazy to wake up early knowing that my school is near my house. It’s the 2nd day of the school year and so far, I’m enjoying the ambience and the professors so far are guiding us on what we need to learn in this course. I’m an extrovert person, I hate being alone all the time. I love to meet new people and make friends with them actually I can make friends that fast because I can adapt to their behavior. I value friendship yes, I have lots of friends but I only trust my real friends. I love to cook and I think that is my passion, I try to experiment on different spices that can make the specific food taste different and better than the traditional one. I play basketball and volleyball but I’m not very good at it. I’m easily to be friend with and I’m open on meeting new people. I play DOTA 2 when I have past time and I can play it all day long. I used to play LOL and I'm also addicted there so I spend money to buy items there.</p>

										<p>The one thing that I can’t forget about is when SHS years came in and I’m the only one who doesn’t have a sit so I have to stand there for almost an hour and luckily one of the professors came so I that person gave me a sit and with that I sat in front, I don’t want that seat but I don’t have choice so throughout the school year I sat there in front. It’s embarrassing I know but I deal with it and everything is alright.</p>

										<p>I expect this class would be light and the professor will help us understand the subject very well. This class will help us build a good and on standard UI’s. Looking forward that we all have a good grade and we can consume the information and retain in our minds.</p>

										<p>To sum it up, I'm a friendly person and I love to meet new people and be friend with them. Sometimes I'm lazy but still I want to learn the things that are needed for our future path. I'm a gamer and same with others I want to be one of the best players that people may know. I'm eager to learn and willing to learn.</p>

												      	<p><strong> FIRST WEEK OF USERDES </strong></p>	
										      			<p>After several meetings I’ve noticed that the subject that we are facing is heavy but
														because of the teacher we are not experiencing any difficulties yet. Because I can
														see the effort that you’re exerting, you made the subject easy the same time we
														are learning and digesting the ideas that you want us to have. You thought us
														about considering others opinion and helping one another to have a good,
														balance decision or way or thinking. Personally, I take others opinion but still do
														what I want and thinking that, that my idea is better and not considering their
														opinions, but now I’m starting to incorporate the opinions and idea of others if
														that will make the project or what I’m doing the best version possible. I’ve
														realized that we are one in this block, that we support and help one another to be
														better and I can see that we are enjoying ourselves in this course. I wish that we
														won’t end up separating and we will graduate as MI 181 together.

														I hope that this progress will continue, in a way that we will surely learn the
														lessons very well and not just a waste of time. I can see that you are doing your
														best to have something from us or any idea that we have, and I appreciate that.
														Please don’t get tired of doing your best and please always make sure that we
														understand the subject or the specific lesson that you want to give. I do listen to
														you and I sometimes notice that some are doing their own business but PLEASE
														have more patience to them and make do something to make them listen to you
														again. Again, miss please help us understand the subject very well because we
														need it in our future subject. Thank you and keep up the hard work</div>

									            <p>I found it<strong> hard </strong>to find a problem that the group can relate on, we usually give possible solutions right
												away and sometimes we just give an easy solution for a problem that doesn’t really need an application
												to be fixed. After giving different solutions finally we came up with 1 application that will help people
												find the nearby hospitals. We don’t have the name yet, but we have some of the functionalities with it.
												One of the functionalities of the application is, you will able to find out if the hospital has vacant room or
												none. Next is that you may be able to see the information of the selected hospital and the specialists
												that the hospital has. The application can give you the route to take whenever you are in a hurry to go to
												the hospital and many features are needed to be discuss by the group. The paper prototyping is also
												hard to do because we all have our own idea on how the application will look like and we cannot decide
												on what to use or place the specific feature of the application. We are currently on the process of doing
												the paper prototyping and I can say that this might be a good one because we are helping one another
												to make this project good and the best as much as possible.</p>

									            <p>Doing website is not new to me because we used to do that way back on senior high school years. The
												only problem that I encounter is to use the Github repository and Heroku. In Github, I don’t know how
												to create a repository, so I ask help to my friends that’s why it took several minutes to be able to create
												a repository. After creating repository, I need to enter my account on Heroku unfortunately I forgot my
												password and I need to re-enter it again and again but still can’t find the right password for that. I’ve
												decided to create another account and with that I may be able to launch my simple website in Heroku. It
												was fun while having these difficulties because I may be able to learn new things, and this gave me a
												lesson too. I need to have a master list of my accounts for scenarios like this, but I need to make sure
												that I’m the only one who know where it is. I also want to add that this activity made me refresh my
												knowledge about creating your own website. I made it without any template because I want to
												experience the feeling of doing it by yourself, simple yet presentable. I made a mistake about the
												contrast of the background and the color of the letter that I chose but still I presented it. Next time I will
												try my best to make sure that everything is readable and can be seen easily.</p>

									            <p>I’m also guilty about this UI bad practice because I tend to do some user interface that don’t have the
												best appearance. For example in the contrast of the background against the text, sometimes I don’t
												consider the font color if the will match the background, for my perspective it blends well because I love
												to use dark colors but not knowing that it doesn’t have a good contrast at all. Next is creating a
												responsive design, this is a must because not all device has the same measurement of screen. You
												should learn how to do a responsive design so that your work would be compatible in different kind of
												device. I’ve learned this feature when we have our internship and the teach me a lesson that you should
												always consider the benefit of all rather than just finishing the program. Next is that you should learn
												how to cite sources if and only if you get something that belongs to a person or individual to credit their
												work and as a sign of respect to the creator. Don’t copy without giving them credits. Next, learn about
												the consistency of the design, it’s better to be simple yet understandable then complex and good design
												but the user may have a hard time using your program.</p>

									            <p>I’m only a participant in the SOCIT FEST, I’ve failed to be an organizer of this event. This is one of my regrets in life, on not to be an organizer of an event. I would love to experience the pressure on organizing the event, finding a good and reliable speaker, and how it feels to have a successful event. The event that really loved the most is about the reality lens; this made my curiosity ring and I feel to alive in watching how it goes and/or how to use it. I really love to experience the new creation of our technology and I’m aspiring to create one too. I think those events that has an unprepared speaker, I wish for the next SOCIT FEST, we should have a sure and ready speaker than what happened earlier. Next is that I hope that in the next SOCIT FEST we will have a good and interactive event that will encourage the participants to really listen and enjoy at the same time. One more thing to improve is make sure that all the participants really want to join the event because I think that the speaker can feel if the participants really wanted to listen or not. He or she might be distracted and cannot deliver what he or she really wanted to say. Given these statements, I hope that the next SOCIT FEST has a cool and interactive approach so that participants will more likely enjoy the event.</p>

									            <p>USERDES is good, I’m enjoying myself with this subject. USERDES gave me a time to breathe from other subjects. Yes, this subject gave me time to breathe the same time I’m learning the things that are needed to be learn by the students. There are no challenges that I’m encountering right now because I can accomplish the task that are needed to be done without any mediocrity in in. I’m happy that I’m learning while I’m enjoying my journey here in this USERDER I hope that this will continue until finals. I wish that we all finish this subject successfully and I hope those people that are behind can help themselves to catch up. I expect in this coming final is that, there will be more activities that we need to do, more coding that we need to do, and lastly, we will have more group work to accomplish. I think the only thing that we could improve on is, have a good and interactive activity that the students will surely enjoy and will remember that activity. You are doing fine on teaching us and I can see the effort that you are exerting. Keep it up and thank you miss.</p>

					               	<p><strong>FAVORITE APPLICATION</strong></p>
					               	<img src = "images/logo.jpeg" style = "width:100%;">
					                <p>One of my most favorite application is Swiftkey keyboard, this is a virtual keyboard app developed by
									TouchType and this is available on both platforms, android and iOS. This application is flexible, it can
									adopt on how you type on your keyboard. I’m using this application since I got this Huawei P20 and
									approximately it is a year ago and still up to now. This has features of resize the size of the keyboard,
									wherein you can adjust it depending on your type. Adjustable duration of long press, it will always
									depend on the user on how long the user wants to press to make use of the other thing in the keyboard,
									where you can see in the top part of each key. Prediction is one of the most useful features here in the
									swiftkey keyboard. Since it learns on how you type, it will show you at the top part of the keyboard what
									you want to say or it will make the correction for you. Next is the availability of the language, this
									keyboard allows you to switch on different language depending on the user. Next is it has a lot theme
									and you can download it as long as you have internet connection. Then the next thing that I love about
									this application is typing heatmap wherein it records your most used key in the keyboard. The next one
									is Taps saved where in this record each letter that you type then it also records the words predicted and
									lastly, the words completed for you these are the words that you just click then completed what you
									want to say.</p>

					               	<p><strong>10000 FLOOR ELEVATOR</strong></p>
					               	<center><img src = "images/A3.PNG"></center>
					             	<p>For me, there should be several elevators for example elevator a,
									elevator b, elevator c, and so on until 10 slots of elevator for people
									waiting to go down and to go up. The higher the floor, the more the
									carriage circulating or working a single slot of elevator that should work
									because they will consume time waiting for their turn to go up and for
									those people that are going down. Each elevator has its own
									destination, for example first lane of elevator will go from 1 st floor up to
									20 th floor, next is 1 st to 40 th then the range will get higher and higher and
									with that, it won’t consume a lot of elevators and space. It will cater 20-
									40 people each elevator then, the elevator is looping but it will stop on
									to your desired floor. Instead of buttons, I will design it like a screen
									and like a calculator that you need to click on an LCD and put your floor
									so that it won’t have a lot of buttons because you have a lot of floors. In
									the LCD there will be the numbers like in the keypad of a calculator, 2
									buttons for close and open, 2 buttons for emergency purposes. The
									screen also has its own advertisement screen to prevent the boredom
									of the people inside, it is connected to a TV so that all the passenger
									can see what is being advertised or the entertainment scene. Then each
									elevator has its own sensor device to detect if there is a near elevator
									ahead and in the downside and it will automatically slow down to
									prevent collision. The higher the floor you want to go, the faster the
									elevator will be so that it won’t consume your precious time, but it will
									always be balance that the passengers won’t fly or have any trouble
									going into their destination.</p>
